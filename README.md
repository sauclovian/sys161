This is the GitHub mirror tree for the System/161 machine emulator.

It is a full-system multiprocessor MIPS emulator with simplified
hardware devices, used for teaching and experimental kernel
development.

See [os161.org](http://www.os161.org/index.html#sys161) for further
information.

Install instructions are in [the doc directory](doc/install.html).

Note that this is a downstream mirror tree and not the reference
repository; it contains releases and occasional snapshots, but will
not in general update separately for every change.
